1 - Sending Message through a socket, it must be in the form of a buffer

2 - The specific protocol we should follow to get the list of peers from the tracker : 
    - send a connect request
    - get the connect response and extract the connection id
    - Use the connection id to send an announce request
     this is where we tell the tracker which files we're interested in
    - Get the announce response and extract the peers list


3 - For making an UDP connect Request for a BitTorrent tracker we should follow the protocol (BEP 15)
    that we should allocates a 16 byte buffer for the message and the structure look like this : 

    Offset	Length	Field
    0	    8	    connection_id
    8	    4	    action (0 = connect)
    12	    4	    transaction_id
